# project introduction
0x02 Session Authentication refers to the process of validating and managing user sessions within a computer system or application. In the realm of cybersecurity, session authentication plays a crucial role in ensuring that only authorized users can access protected resources and services.

Essentially, session authentication involves the verification of a user's identity and permissions during their active session, typically initiated after successful login. This verification process often includes techniques such as token-based authentication, session cookies, or other cryptographic mechanisms to securely authenticate users and maintain the integrity of their sessions.

Effective session authentication mechanisms not only authenticate users at the beginning of a session but also continuously verify their identity and permissions throughout the session to prevent unauthorized access. This helps in safeguarding sensitive data and resources from unauthorized access or misuse, thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the system or application.
